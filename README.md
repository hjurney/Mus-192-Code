Music 192 Senior Project Code - Trumpet Sound Synthesis Model
Henry Jurney

This is the corresponding python script that I built and used for my Mus 192 project. Please feel free to use and play with the model yourself, the code should be commented enough for a basic understanding.

Example outputs for a standard setup are included for reference.

Please reach out to me at henryjurney@gmail.com for the associated paper or issues with the code!
